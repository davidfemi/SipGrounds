A map‚Äëfirst caf√© discovery website with points, coupon‚Äëcode perks, polls, and Stripe payments. All caf√©s are pre‚Äëonboarded partners.

## 1) Product Overview

**Elevator pitch:** Sip Grounds helps people discover great partner caf√©s on a map, pay seamlessly, earn points instantly, and redeem for drinks, pastries, or swag. Perks are distributed via alphanumeric coupon codes.

**Primary goals**

* Increase foot traffic & repeat visits for partner caf√©s.
* Give customers a simple, rewarding experience (discover ‚Üí pay ‚Üí earn ‚Üí redeem).
* Keep engagement high via polls and photo reviews.

**Assumptions (change anytime):**

* Phase 1 is **web-first** (responsive). Native apps later.
* Payments: Stripe Checkout/Payment Elements; card-on-file for 1‚Äëclick reorders.
* Pre‚Äëonboarded partners are added by an internal admin (no self‚Äëserve onboarding in MVP).
* Dummy data for caf√©s + orders in dev; production uses Stripe + Postgres.
